So i started the HNG Internship 5 and I am reporting on a glitch I have found on Timbu.com.
It is as a result of a variable that has not been assigned a value hence, it throws an `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'origin' of null`

The error can be found [here](timbu.com/flights). This is not an error that can lead to ground-breaking changes but one worth fixing. A screenshot of the error can be found below:
