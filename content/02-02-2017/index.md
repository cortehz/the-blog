So I started the HNG Internship 5. It is a three-month long remote internship where you complete tasks in other to make it to the end - the 10th stage. The task to get to stage 2 is about finding any bug or problem at all on timbu.com.

So, here I am reporting on a error I have found on Timbu.com. The error can be found [HERE](http://timbu.com/flights). It is an error thrown as a result of a variable that has not been assigned a value hence, it throws an `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'origin' of null`

This is not an error that can lead to ground-breaking changes but one worth fixing. A screenshot of the error can be found below:
